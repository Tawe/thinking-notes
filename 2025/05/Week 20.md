# ðŸ“… Week 20 â€“ May 12â€“16, 2025

**Summary:**  
A fast-moving week. We kicked off the AI Steering Committee, pitched our rollout plan to the execs (which was approved), and I learned Iâ€™ll now be leading the initiative solo due to a partner departure. There were also important conversations around AI security, infra, and developer onboarding.

**What I Did:**  
- Led AI Steering Committee kickoff  
- Presented AI rollout plan to execsâ€”received approval  
- Met with ITSec to assess Cursor-related risks (SSO, prompt monitoring)  
- Drafted learning plan for dev team adoption  
- Initiated rollout of a JavaScript hook to check for secrets in code  
- Advocated for stronger SSO and 2FA adoption  
- Raised concerns around server infrastructure changes and CI/CD regressions

**Result:**  
- AI rollout plan approved by exec team  
- Security remains an open risk, especially around prompt observability  
- Partner for AI initiative is leavingâ€”Iâ€™ll now lead it solo  
- Cursor learning plan drafted; dev rollout to come  
- Tickets created to implement secret-checking hook across all sites

**Reflection:**  
This week was hands-on in ways I havenâ€™t experienced in a while. I wrote more code than usualâ€”partly out of necessity, since Iâ€™m closest to how these AI tools actually work and what risks they pose. Putting guardrails in place has fallen to me, and while thatâ€™s weighty, it feels right.

The AI Steering Committee went well, though Iâ€™ll need to spend time building buy-in from a few hesitant voices. The sudden shift in leadership responsibility caught me off guard, but I know Iâ€™m capable of carrying this forward.

On another note, the infrastructure shift raised red flagsâ€”moving away from our current CI/CD flow to manual server updates feels like a regression. I voiced this, and Iâ€™ll keep an eye on how it plays out.

Despite some low compensation adjustments, the team seems to be in good spirits. Thereâ€™s energy hereâ€”and thatâ€™s worth protecting.
