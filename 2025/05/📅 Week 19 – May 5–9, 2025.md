We completed our annual compensation review, advanced our internal AI initiative (particularly around Cursor integration), and finalized role expectations across the development team. The comp review sparked important questions around performance culture, motivation, and whether low turnover is always a healthy signal.

**What I Did:**  
- Participated in and finalized decisions for the compensation review process.  
- Finished and distributed updated expectations for all dev roles.  
- Continued development and risk assessment for our AI assistant initiative, with a focus on Cursor.  
- Began reviewing internal data security posture in light of potential AI tool usage.

**Result:**  
- Compensation adjustments completed. Role expectations are now documented and shared, which should increase clarity and accountability across teams.  
- Cursor integration continues, with increased focus on privacy and data handling risks.  
- Raised internal awareness of performance plateaus and began surfacing the question of what “value” looks like beyond delivery.

**Reflection:**  
Our team’s near-zero turnover over the last five years reflects a strong culture—but may also signal a lack of renewal. While consistency is good, I’ve noticed some individuals doing the minimum required without investing in growth. It’s made me reconsider how we define “good enough,” and whether predictability is being mistaken for contribution.

Not everyone needs to be a multiplier all the time—but what do we do when someone consistently avoids ownership, improvement, or curiosity? How do we re-ignite drive without burning people out? Or, more uncomfortably: are there cases where we should consider making room for new energy?

The AI work, especially with Cursor, has made me think more deeply about responsible rollout. Data privacy and misuse risks are real. I need to ensure we’re not only experimenting fast—but protecting wisely.
